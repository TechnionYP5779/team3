This repo is a part of the software engineering yearly project in The Technion - Israel Institute of Technology.
The goal is to refactor some Spartanizer code (basically refactor the refactoring code)

# <a name="introduction"></a>The Spartanizer is:
- An Eclipse plugin
- Offers in the problems view tips for simplifying your code 
- Make your code laconic: say much in few words.
- Platform for other research: nano-patterns, source to source transformation, and The Athenizer
